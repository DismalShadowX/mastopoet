# Contributing

Thank you for having interest in contributing to Mastopoet!

Firstly, I would recommend discussing your contribution with the developer ([@raikas@mementomori.social](https://mementomori.social/@raikas)), so we don't accidentally work on the same feature.

## Project setup

I recommend using Node LTS (at the moment v18.17) and latest NPM.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run Vite with `npm run dev`
3. Open app in http://localhost:5173 (or the address Vite shows you in CLI)

## Pull requests

When your feature is ready, create a pull request for it on Github. I will try to review them quickly ðŸ˜Š
